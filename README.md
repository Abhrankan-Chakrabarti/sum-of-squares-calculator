# Sum of Squares Calculator

This repository contains a simple Python script for calculating the sum of squares of consecutive integers. The script takes an input value `n` and computes the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers.

## Usage

To use the calculator, clone the repository to your local machine and run the Python script `sum_of_squares.py` with the desired value of `n` as an argument.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhrankan-Chakrabarti/sum-of-squares-calculator.git
cd sum-of-squares-calculator
python sum_of_squares.py n
```

Replace `n` with the desired number of consecutive integers.

## Example

For example, to calculate the sum of squares of the first 5 natural numbers, run:

```bash
python sum_of_squares.py 5
```

The script will output:

```
The sum of the squares of the first 5 natural numbers is: 55
```
